We explored how to query and filter data from the cards_data table using essential SQL commands. We used SELECT to retrieve specific columns and rows, and applied WHERE to filter records based on conditions such as card brand, chip availability, and expiration details. The OR operator helped us return results that satisfied at least one of multiple conditions, while BETWEEN allowed us to filter numeric or date ranges like PIN change years or number of cards issued. We used LIKE to search for text patterns, such as finding cards expiring in a certain year. ORDER BY helped us sort the results by fields like credit limit or number of cards issued. Finally, because the credit_limit column contained values with a dollar sign stored as text, we used REPLACE and CAST together to convert them into numbers so they could be compared properly in our queries.
